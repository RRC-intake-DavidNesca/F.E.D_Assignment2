## Purpose
This file explains my small design system for the resume site. I wrote it so I can stay consistent as I build and update the page.

## Colour Palette

I use **three core colours** that work well together. I also use a couple of neutral support colours for backgrounds and borders.

### Core colours 
1) **Accent (links and actions):** `#2563eb`  
   - Reason: A friendly blue that stands out for links.  
   - Accessibility: Blue on white is readable (good contrast).

2) **Text (headings and body):** `#111827`  
   - Reason: Almost black for strong readability on white and light gray.  
   - This is used for most text.

3) **Muted (dates and small notes):** `#6b7280`  
   - Reason: Softer gray for secondary details.  
   - Keeps focus on the main content while still readable.

### Support (neutrals)
- **Background page:** `#ffffff` (white)  
- **Surface (cards/sections):** `#f8fafc` (very light gray)  
- **Border (separators):** `#e5e7eb` (light gray line)

### How I use these colors
- Links and interactive elements → **Accent** `#2563eb`  
- Main text and headings → **Text** `#111827`  
- Dates, locations, small notes → **Muted** `#6b7280`  
- Section cards → **Surface** with a **Border** to separate sections

## Layout Notes 
- **Header:** Grid with two columns (photo + identity) so it is balanced.
- **Main:** One column on small screens; two columns on desktop for easier scanning.
- **Spacing:** Simple padding and gaps; rounded corners on section cards so they feel friendly.
