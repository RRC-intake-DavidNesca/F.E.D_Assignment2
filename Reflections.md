# Reflection â€“ Assignment 1: Personal Resume

## What my page contains
- Semantic structure: header, navigation, main (About, Education, Experience, Skills, Projects), and footer.
- One profile image with meaningful alt text and a simple size attribute.
- An inline SVG icon in the Skills heading.
- In-page navigation links to each section.

## My process
- Laid out a comment skeleton to structure the assignment.
- Began to build the HTML sections step by step.
- Wrote short, clear headings and bullets.
- Ran a validator check and fixed any warnings.

## Challenges
- (Example) Getting the image path and filename case to match the folder.
- (Example) Deciding what to include as concise bullets.
- INDENTATION (Still working on this one)

## Improvements next time
- Focus on studying proper indentation for HTML.
- Edit wording for clarity and brevity.
